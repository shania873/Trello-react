# Mini-Trello in React and Node.js

A task management project built with Node.js (back-end) and React (front-end).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to view the application.

The page will reload whenever you make changes.\
Lint errors, if any, will be displayed in the console.

For communication with the API in Node.js, use the following request: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Make sure to create a database (api-trello) if it's your first time running the application!

### `npm test`

Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.\
This process correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for optimal performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is now ready for deployment!

Explore the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for further information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands, except `eject`, will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts for customization. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to use `eject` ever. The curated feature set is suitable for small and mid-sized deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready.
